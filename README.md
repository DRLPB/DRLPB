# An Optimization Framework based on Deep Reinforcement Learning Approaches for Prism Blockchain

This project is the implementation of [DRLPB Scheme](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10038442).

## **Description**
Blockchains have proven to provide a high level of performance in terms of security and reliability for various
applications like cryptocurrencies and Internet-of-Things (IoT).
Prism is a recent blockchain algorithm that achieves the physical
limit on throughput and latency without compromising security.
In recent days, reinforcement learning approaches are investi-
gated in traditional blockchains, to improve performance. In
this work, we apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to
one of the promising blockchain protocols, Prism, to optimize
its performance. We propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning-
based Prism Blockchain (DRLPB) scheme which dynamically
optimizes the parameters of the Prism blockchain and helps in
achieving a better performance. In DRLPB, we apply two widely
used DRL algorithms, Dueling Deep Q Networks (DDQN) and
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). This work presents a novel
approach to applying DDQN and PPO to a blockchain protocol
and comparing the performance. The DRLPB scheme adapts the
Prism blockchain parameters to enhance the number of votes, while still preserving the security
and latency performance guarantees of Prism.
